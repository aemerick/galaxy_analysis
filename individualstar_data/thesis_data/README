These are the data file inputs used in the series of "Leo P"
isolated galaxy runs published in my (Andrew Emerick) thesis
and subsequent papers (Emerick+2018-2020). These are stored here
for posterity and since the new version of the code (as of April 2020)
is no longer compatible with these tables.

In particular, these tables include 2 known bugs:

    1) A factor of pi was missing in computing the integration
       for the FUV flux and LW flux bands. This means the adopted
       radiation rates for these bands were low by a factor of pi.
       The radiation rates for HI and HeI ionization were O.K.

    2) The FUV and LW rate tables were constructed using a method
       that relied on a dictionary. In Python 2, the dictionary
       keyword order did not persist and this led to the columns
       being scrambled such that the metallicities were incorrect.
       This is a much smaller issue than #1.

    3) The FUV band in this table covers 5.6 - 13.6 eV and LW 
       11.2 - 13.6 eV. Changes to Enzo implementation were made 
       such that these should not be overlapping. The new tables
       contain FUV and LW from 5.6 - 11.2 and 11.2 - 13.6 
       respectively


The IMF-averaged yields were used only in a few isolated tests
