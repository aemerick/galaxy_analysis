Datasets needed to run the individual star routines in Enzo

This *should* all be combined into a single or small number
of hdf5 files, but for now they are all ascii files


parsec_zams.in:
    PARSEC zero age main sequence (ZAMS) data set containing
    columns of:
      stellar mass (Msun)
      metallicity (fraction)
      log(luminosity) (solar units)
      log(T_eff)      (solar units)
      log(Radius)     (solar units)
      lifetime        (s)
      agb-phase       (S)

    agb-phase is the start time of the AGB phase of the star's
    lifetime (if there is one). If there is no AGB phase, this
    is equal to the lifetime.

qx_photon_rates.in:

    Ionizing photon rates for HI (q0), HeI (q1), and HeII (q2)
    ionizing photon as tabulated from the OSTAR2002 model 
    of stellar atmosphere grid. Columns are:

       T_eff    (K)
       log(g)   (cgs)

       col 3 - 12 photon_flux (1/s/cm^2) for each
                  metallicity bin

LW_energy_rates.in, IR_energy_rates.in, FUV_energy_rates.in:

    Energy fluxes in certain bands from the OSTAR2002 model.
    Same columns as the ionizing photon rate files, but 
    units are erg/s/cm^2.

    LW band  : 11.2 - 13.6 eV
    FUV band :  5.6 - 11.2 eV
    IR band  : 0.76 - 5.6  eV
